Partial Power Management
------------------------

The voltage ``5V_PERIPH`` supplies the following *GW4100* components:

- CAN transceiver (U1101)
- RS232 transceiver (U1100)
- RS485 transceiver (U1104/U1103)
- IÂ²C driven 1wire bus master (U1102)
- the expansion board connector

Since the ``5V_PERIPH`` power supply is switchable, all these devices can be
powered only at once, never independently. Further more, in order to save
power, the data lines between the i.MX7 SoC and the switched devices need some
preparation to avoid power leakage. This cannot be done for all device at the
same time in a safe manner and thus, the ``5V_PERIPH`` power supply gets
switched on in the bootloader and never switched off again after that.

.. hint:: If the partitions are not working at run-time, compare the image size
          against the eMMC size. Strange things happen, if the image is larger
          than the available eMMC capacity

.. warning:: As of September 2020 the bootloader's *fastboot* feature seems
             broken regarding images larger than 2 GiB and/or 4 GiB. In order
             to prepare the eMMC successfully a different transfer method must
             be used, to bring the image into the device.
