	  The ssh library was designed to be used by programmers
	  needing a working SSH implementation by the mean of a
	  library. The complete control of the client is made by the
	  programmer. With libssh, you can remotely execute programs,
	  transfer files, use a secure and transparent tunnel for your
	  remote programs. With its SFTP implementation, you can play
	  with remote files easily.
